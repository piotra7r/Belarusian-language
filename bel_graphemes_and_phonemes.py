# The letter "ґ" is not used often, and is usually replaced by "г"
# The apostrophe ("’" or "'") is used to denote a hard consonant before the combination /j/ + vowel; less often, this sign is used to denote abbreviated words, which are most often transmitted without it
# The letters "яеёю" are used to indicate the combination /j/ + vowel /aɛɔu/ respectively, or the softness of the preceding consonant (except for cases where these letters and the consonant are separated by an apostrophe) before the vowel.

# The phoneme /g/ rarely occurs, in some words; and also it replaces /ɣ/ in position after /zsʐʂk/
# These phonemes do not have a soft pair: /d t ɖʐ ʈʂ ʐ ʂ r w/
# The /j/ is always soft
# Labials /pbvfm/ usually are soft only before vowels
# The phoneme /w/ in Belarusian words usually occurs only in closed syllables after vowels (as /äw ɛw iw ɨw ɔw uw/)
# Variations of vowels:
# /ä/: /ä Cʲa/
# /ɛ/: /ɜ Cʲɛ/
# /i/: /'i ɪ 'ji- jɪ-/
# /ɨ/
# /ɔ/: /ɔ Cʲɔ̈/
# /u/: /'u ʊ 'Cʲʉ Cʲʊ̈/
